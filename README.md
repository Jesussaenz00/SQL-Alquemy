# SQL-Alquemy
Challenge 10

The purpose of this project is to perform a climate analysis of Honolulu, Hawaii, using historical weather data to better understand the region's climate trends. This analysis will aid in planning a long vacation by providing insights into precipitation patterns and temperature variations. Additionally, by designing a Flask API, we aim to make this climate data accessible and reusable for further exploration or future trip planning.

Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data
In this section, you'll use Python and SQLAlchemy to explore and analyze climate data stored in a SQLite database. You'll leverage libraries like SQLAlchemy ORM, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

Part 2: Design Your Climate App
Using the insights gained from your analysis, create a Flask API to expose the climate data through various routes.
